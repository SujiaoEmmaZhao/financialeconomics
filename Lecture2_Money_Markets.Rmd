## Primary Functions of Money

### **Medium of Exchange**

Money promotes economic efficiency by minimizing the time spent in exchanging goods and services

### **Unit of Account**

Money is used to measure value in an economy

### **Store of Value**

Money is a repository of purchasing power available over time (e.g., from the time income is received until the time it is spent)

## What Is Money?

- Mishkin (2018)
.font80[
<blockquote>
Money is anything that is generally accepted as payment for goods or services or in the repayment of debts.
</blockquote>
]

- Irving Fisher:  "*The Purchasing Power of Money II, 1*"
.font80[
<blockquote>
We define money as what is generally acceptable in exchange for goods. The facility with which it may thus be exchanged, or its general acceptability, is its distinguishing characteristic. The general acceptability may be reenforced by law, the money thus becoming what is known as "legal tender"; but such reenforcement is not essential.” 
</blockquote>
]

- Milton Friedman
.font80[
<blockquote>
The pieces of green paper have value because everyone thinks they have value.
</blockquote>
]


- Money is the most liquid asset of all
.font80[
<blockquote>
.bold[Liquidity]: the relative ease and speed with which an asset can be converted into a medium of exchange.

M2: near-money accounts (medium liquidity, store of value, interest-bearing, below $100,000). 
</blockquote>

1. Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual fund shares

2. Savings deposits and small-denomination time deposits

]

.font80[
<blockquote>
M3: near-money accounts (low liquidity, unite of account, above $100,000).

]


???
M1
1. Currency (paper money and coins in the hands of the nonbank public)
2. Checking account deposits (checking accounts, debit accounts; business checking accounts that do not pay interest, traveler’s checks issued by banks)
3. Traveler’s checks not issued by banks

M2
1. Assets that have check-writing features (money market deposit accounts and money market mutual fund shares) 

2. Other assets (savings deposits and small-denomination time deposits)

## ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem

- 1 January, 1999: the European Central Bank (ECB) started to take the responsibility for conducting monetary policy for the euro area.

- The responsibility for monetary policy was transferred from the national central banks of 11 EU Member States to the ECB. 

- Now 19 countries have joined the euro area
   - Greece joined in 2001
   - Slovenia in 2007 
   - Cyprus and Malta in 2008
   - Slovakia in 2009
   - Estonia in 2011
   - Latvia in 2014
   - Lithuania in 2015

## ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem

**European Central Bank (ECB)**: The core of the Eurosystem and the ESCB. The ECB and the national central banks together perform the tasks they have been entrusted with.

**European System of Central Banks (ECSB)**: The ESCB comprises the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of all EU Member States whether they have adopted the euro or not.

**Eurosystem**: The Eurosystem comprises the ECB and the NCBs of those countries that have adopted the euro. 

**Euro area**: The euro area consists of the EU countries that have adopted the euro.

<blockquote>
.font80[**Contractionary Monetary Policy**: monetary policy designed to decrease aggregate demand, decrease output, and increase unemployment]
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
.font80[**Expansionary Monetary Policy**: monetary policy designed to increase aggregate demand, increase output, and decrease unemployment]
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
.font80[**Policy Interest Rate**: the interest rate on overnight loans from one bank to another, e.g., i.e., Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, SHIBOR]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
.font80[**Discount Rate**: i.e., The interest rate charged by the Fed on the reserves borrowed from the Fed]
</blockquote>

???

Because money affects many economic variables that are important to the well-being of our economy, politicians and policymakers throughout the world care about the conduct of monetary policy, the management of money and interest rates. The organization responsible for the conduct of a nation’s monetary policy is the central bank.

Fiscal policy involves decisions about government spending and taxation. budget deficit vs. budget surplus

   Discount rate increases --> federal funds rate increases
   
???
Open market operations target the rate that banks charge other banks, usually for very short-term loans.

It might sound weird that a bank would want to borrow money from another bank, but it happens all the time. For example, sometimes banks have an unexpected withdrawal and fall below their required reserves. A bank could borrow money from another bank with excess reserves to meet that requirement. A bank might have a customer that wants to borrow money from it, but doesn’t have the excess reserves to do so. That bank can borrow money from another bank that does have excess reserves, and then make the loan to its customer

## Limitations of Monetary Policy

### .font90[Monetary policy, like fiscal policy, suffers from lags that might hamper how effective it can be at closing an output gap]

- It takes time to recognize that there is a problem in the economy and react

- The impact of the interest rate change takes time (e.g., changes in the overnight rate to pass through to other interest rates)

$$ \Delta{D} =\frac{1}{rr} \times \Delta{R}$$

.font90[where $\Delta{D}$ = change in total checkable deposits in the banking system;
      rr = required reserve ratio; 
      $\Delta{R}$ = change in reserves for the banking system.]

      
- **Assumption**: Banks do not hold on to any excess reserves


---

##  Money Multiplier

### **Other Players**

*The simple model assumes that Federal Reserve is able to exercise complete control over the level of checkable deposits by setting the required reserve ratio and the level of reserves.*

- **Depositors**

*What if some proceeds from loans are not deposited in banks but instead are used to raise the holdings of currency?*

- **Banks**

*What if Banks decide to hold on excess reserves?*

.font90[
$$m = \frac{M}{MB}$$

.font90[m= money multiplier; 
M = money supply; 
MB = monetary base]


$$MB = R + C = RR + ER + C = (rr\times{D}) + ER + C$$ 

$$MB = (rr\times{D}) + (e\times{D}) + (c\times{D}) = (rr + e + c)\times{D} = (rr + e + c)\times{D}$$ 

$$M = M1 = D + C = D + c\times{D} = (1+c)\times{D}$$

$$m = \frac{M}{MB} = \frac{(1+c)\times{D}}{(rr + e + c)\times{D}} =\frac{1+c}{rr+e+c} $$
.font90[R= total reserves; 
RR = required reserves; 
ER = excess reserves;
D = checkable deposits;
rr = required reserve ratio;
C = currency;
e = ER/D;
c = C/D]

]


???
Open market operations change the non-borrowed monetary base, but the impact on the money supply is larger due to the money multiplier

We can use the money multiplier to predict the maximum change in the money supply that will occur as a result of the OMO. If the money multiplier is 4, then the money supply will increase by up to \$4{,}000$4,000dollar sign, 4, comma, 000.

- Quantitative Easing

  - Used when interest rates are already near 0 percent and can be focused on the purchase of **government bonds and other financial assets** from banks
  
  - Objective is to shore up bank liquidity and lift inflation

## Market for Reserves

- The market for reserves is where the federal funds rate is determined

- The quantity of reserves demanded by banks: required reserves + excess reserves

- The cost of holding excess reserves is the opportunity cost — the interest rate that could have been earned on lending these reserves out minus the interest rate that is earned on these reserves

Euribor, or the Euro Interbank Offer Rate, is a reference rate that is constructed from the average interest rate at which eurozone banks offer unsecured short-term lending on the inter-bank market. The maturities on loans used to calculate Euribor often range from one week to one year.

---

##  [Federal Funds Rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)

- Borrowing and lending in the federal funds market established the federal funds rate.

- The Fed tried to affect the federal funds rate by conducting open market operations and through this tool affect the credit conditions and the rest of the economy.

##  [Libor Rates](https://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/libor/libor.aspx)

- LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate) is the average interbank interest rate at which a selection of banks on the London money market are prepared to lend to one another.

- LIBOR comes in 7 maturities (from overnight to 12 months) and in 5 different currencies.

- LIBOR is considered as the most important benchmark in the world for short-term interest rates


???
 Although reference is often made to the LIBOR interest rate, there are actually a lot of different LIBOR interest rates. LIBOR is calculated for 7 different maturities and for 5 different currencies. The official LIBOR interest rates are announced once a day at around 11:45 a.m. London time by ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). 

???
LIBOR is watched closely by both professionals and private individuals because the LIBOR interest rate is used as a base rate (benchmark) by banks and other financial institutions. Rises and falls in the LIBOR interest rates can therefore have consequences for the interest rates on all sorts of banking products such as savings accounts, mortgages and loans.


---

##  [Euribor Rates](https://www.euribor-rates.eu/en/euribor-charts/)

The Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) rates are based on the interest rates at which [a panel of 20 European banks](https://www.euribor-rates.eu/en/panelbanks/) with the highest volume of business in the euro zone money borrow funds from one another.


##  [Eonia](https://www.euribor-rates.eu/en/eonia/)

Eonia (European Overnight Index Average) is a weighted average of the interest rates on unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euros, as reported by a panel of contributing banks.
.font80[
- Both Euribor and Eonia are offered by the European Money Markets Institute ([EMMI](https://www.emmi-benchmarks.eu/emmi/)).
- Eonia is an overnight rate, while Euribor is the interbank lending rate at various maturities.
- Euribor is calculated by Global Rate Set Systems Ltd., not the ECB.
- Reform underway: EONIA replaced by ESTER (Euro Short-Term Rate), calculated on the wholesale euro unsecured overnight borrowing costs of euro area banks.
]

##  Euribor as Key Base Rate

- The Euribor Rates provide the basis for the price or interest rate of all kinds of financial products, like interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, saving accounts and mortgages.

  - Mortgage based upon an adjustable interest rate: Euribor + fixed commission (e.g., Euribor +1%). 
  
  - The Euribor-rate and the interest rate offered on a savings account are also strongly interrelated.


???
When someone decides to opt in for a mortgage based upon an adjustable interest rate (also know as a floating rate or variable rate mortgage), it is announced beforehand that he or she will pay the Euribor-rate (often the Euribor 1 month or 3 month rate) plus a fixed commission, for example Euribor +1%.

???
When the Euribor rate decreases, the margin the bank makes is decreasing as well. That’s why banks often do decide to lower the interest rate on savings accounts when the Euribor rate decreases and vice versa. However this does often happen at a delay: the interest rate offered by many banks on savings is only altered when there has been a interest market change of some magnitude.
