## Recap. 

- Over-the-Counter Market

    - A decentralized market in which market participants trade financial instruments directly between two parties and without a central exchange or broker. 
    
    - Does not have physical locations; instead, trading is conducted electronically. 
    
    - Typically less transparent than exchanges and are also subject to fewer regulations
    
    - Limited liquidity; liquidity totally dried up in the absence of buyers during the crisis 
    
    - Mortgage-backed securities and other derivatives such as CDOs and CMOs were traded solely in the OTC markets
    
    - Use of clearinghouses for post-trade processing of OTC trades in the aftermath of the crisis

Mishkin (2018): Financial crises are major disruptions in financial markets characterized by sharp declines in asset prices and firm failures. A financial crisis occurs when information flows in financial markets experience a particularly large disruption, with the result that financial frictions increase sharply and financial markets stop functioning.

- Instability was caused from beliefs (excess optimism, lending and investment; correction of expectations due to bad news or waning of optimism; impaired intermediation or excess pessimism)

- A war between small retail investors and institutional investors

- Forcing institutional investors who bet against the company to back out -- performing what's known as a "short squeeze."

<blockquote>
Short squeeze is the phenomenon where short sellers are forced to repurchase stock as prices rise, thereby pushing the price higher.
</blockquote>

<br />

.font100[
*A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock's price.*
