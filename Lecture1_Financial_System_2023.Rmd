# Why Study Finance?

### **Understand financial system --> economy system**


### **Fundamental concepts and theories of money, financial markets and financial institutions**

## Financial Terms

.scroll-output[

**Real Assets**: Used to produce goods and services: Property, plants and equipment, human capital, etc.

**Financial Assets**: Claims on real assets or claims on real-asset income
	
**Security** (or *financial instrument*): claim on the issuer’s future income or assets	
	
**Bond**: debt security that promises to make periodic payments for a specified period of time

**Stock**: a share of ownership in a corporation, a claim (residual) on the earnings and assets of the corporation.

**Return**: How well a person does financially by holding a security over a particular time period is accurately measured by the security’s return, or, in more precise terminology, the rate of return.

**Interest Rate**: cost of borrowing or the price paid for the rental of funds

**Real interest rate**: the interest rate that is adjusted by subtracting expected changes in the price level (inflation) so that it more accurately reflects the true cost of borrowing.

**Interest-rate risk**: Changes in interest rates lead to capital gains and losses that produce substantial differences between the return and the yield to maturity known at the time the bond is purchased.

- Suppose you win a lottery of 100 million euros. Do you want to take 5 million a year over 20 years or just get 100 million right now?

- There are 30-year mortgages now you can get for 4.75% interest rate. There are 15-year mortgages you can get for less, for example 4.3% interest. Should you take the 15-year mortgage or the 30-year mortgage?

- You’re making a 50 000 euros a year and you are going to work for 35 years until you retire. Then you’re going to live another 20 years when you’re going to be making nothing. What you’d like to do is to consume inflation corrected the same amount every year after you retire and before you retire. Suppose inflation is 3%. How much of the 50 000 euros should you spend this year and how much should you save?

- A scientist discovers a potential cure for AIDS and he started a company. If it works he’s going to make a fortune. If it doesn’t work it’s going to be totally zero. Say the expected profit is equal to the profits of all of General Electric. Should his company be worth more than GE, the same as GE, or less than GE? 

- Suppose you believed in efficient markets and you rank all the stocks at the end of this year from top to bottom of which stock had the highest return over the year. Now, suppose you did the same thing in the following year with the same stocks, would you expect to get the same order, or the reverse order, or random order? 

- You’re a bank and you hold a bunch of mortgages. And you value all those mortgages at a 100 million euros. Suppose all the people had the same size mortgage. Now the government lowers the interest rates. Half of them take advantage to refinance. That shrunken pool, half as big as the original pool, is that worth 50 million or more than 50 million, or less than 50 million?

- A market where financial instruments like stocks or bonds are created or exchanged


### Financial Intermediation 

-	The process of indirect financing using financial intermediaries, helps getting funds from savers to investors

- Banks and Money Supply: crucial role in creation of money

## Organization  of Financial Markets

### By nature of financial claim: Debt Market vs. Equity Market

- Debt Markets: debt instruments 

- Equity Markets: common stocks (residual claim)


### By seasoning of claim: Primary Market vs. Secondary Market
	
- Primary Market: where securities are created (underwritten by investment banks)

- Secondary Market: where securities are traded (brokers and dealers)





---

## Organization  of Financial Markets


### By organizational structure: Exchange Market vs. OTC Market
	
- Exchanges: Trades conducted in central locations

- Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets: Dealers at different locations buy and sell (e.g., government bonds, federal funds, foreign exchange instruments)


### By maturity of claim: Money Market vs. Capital Market

- Money Market: Short-term (maturity < 1 year), less risky
	
- Capital Market: Long-term (maturity > 1 year), more risky

## Arithmetic Return or Geometric Return? 

If your portfolio goes up by 50% and then declines by 50%, are you back where you started?

--


$$r=\frac{(p_n-p_0)}{p_0}$$

$$1+r=\frac{p_n}{p_0}$$


$$log(1+r)=log(\frac{p_n}{p_0})=log(p_n)-log(p_0)\approx r$$


---

## Arithmetic Return or Geometric Return?


The CAGR (compound annual growth rate, annualized return) is a measurement of the actual return achieved over the number of years examined.


$$CAGR=(\frac{p_n}{p_0})^{(\frac{1}{n})}-1$$


$$(1+r_1) \times (1+r_2)...\times (1+r_n)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}(1+r_i)$$

The compound return over n periods is merely the difference in log between initial and final periods

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N} log(1+r_i)=log(1+r_1) + log(1+r_2) + ...... + log(1+r_n)=log(p_n) - log(p_0)$$

## Bond Pricing

The price or value of a financial asset is equal to the present value of all expected future cash flows.

$$P=\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{C}{(1+r)^i}+ \frac{M}{(1+r)^N}$$

*where* *P* = market price of bond, *C* = coupon payment, *N* = number of payments, *r* = market interest rate, or required yield, or observed/appropriate yield to maturity, *M* = value at maturity, usually equals face value. 

--

- Current bond prices and interest rates are negatively related

- Prices and returns for long-term bonds are more volatile than those for shorter-term bonds

- When the real interest rate is low, there are greater incentives to borrow and fewer incentives to lend.

## Why Are FIs So Important? 


### Transactions Costs
.font80[

- Financial intermediaries make profits by reducing transactions costs 

    - Developing expertise
    
    - **Economies of scale**

- Provide liquidity services that enable depositors to earn interest and yet still convert them into goods and services whenever necessary


]

--


### Risk Sharing
.font80[


- **Diversification**: lower risk by helping people to diversify portfolios, i.e., investing in a portfolio of assets ratehr than in individual assets

- **Asset Transformation**: Create and sell assets with low risk characteristics and then use the funds to buy assets with more risk i.e., risky assets are transformed into safe assets for investors

]

---

## Why Are FIs So Important? 


### Asymmetric Information


#### **Adverse Selection**
.font80[
- Before transaction occurs

- Potential borrowers most likely to produce adverse outcomes are ones most likely to seek loans and be selected
]

#### **Moral Hazard**
.font80[
- After transaction occurs

- Hazard that borrower has incentives to engage in undesirable (immoral) activities making it more likely that won’t pay loan back

- Ubiquity of moral hazard problems

- Practical finance has developed institutions to promote risk management while dealing with moral hazard

]

---

## Why Are FIs So Important? 

### Economies of Scope

- Banks providing multiple financial services to clients, lowering cost of information production


### ! Conflict of Interests

- A type of moral hazard problem, arise when a person or institution has multiple objectives (interests), some of which conflict with each other

- Potentially competing interests of bank services may lead an individual or a firm or a bank to conceal information or disseminate misleading information

## Regulation of Financial System

- Regulations are legal restrictions circulated by government authority

- Financial system is among the most heavily regulated sectors of the economy

- Banks are among the most heavily regulated of financial institutions

- The time and energy spent on regulatory compliance activities are costly

- However, regulations sometimes can’t prevent financial crisis


---

## Main Reasons for Regulation

###  Increasing Information Available to Investors

- Information Disclosure

- Restriction of Insider Trading

###	 Ensuring the soundness of financial intermediaries

- Prevent financial panics and market failure

    - Discosure
    - Deposit Insurance    
    - Restrictions on entry, foreign participation, financial activities, assets held, competition and fairness, interest rates
